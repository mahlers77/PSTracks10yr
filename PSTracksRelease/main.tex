\begin{abstract}
IceCube has performed several all-sky searches for point-like neutrino sources. This paper accompanies the public data release of track-like neutrino candidates detected by IceCube between April 6, 2008 and July 10, 2018. The selection includes through-going tracks, {\it i.e.}, muon neutrino candidates that reach the detector from all directions, as well as neutrino track events that start within the instrumented volume. This data release encompasses events included in earlier data releases with improved event selection and reconstruction.

\section{Introduction}

The IceCube Observatory~\cite{Aartsen:2016nxy} at the geographic South Pole has been operating at full capacity for the past ten years. In 2013, IceCube reported first evidence of an isotropic flux of astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range~\cite{Aartsen:2013bka,Aartsen:2013jdh}. While the flux is by now observed with high significance~\cite{Aartsen:2014gkd,Aartsen:2015rwa,Aartsen:2016xlq,IceCube:2018dnn,IceCube:2018cha} its astrophysical origin remains uncertain~\cite{Ahlers:2018fkn}. In parallel, IceCube has been searching for high-energy neutrino emission from individual point sources, including unbiased all-sky searches~\cite{Abbasi:2010rd,Aartsen:2013uuv,Aartsen:2014cva,Aartsen:2014cva,Aartsen:2018ywr,Aartsen:2019fau} as well as individual source candidates like cores of active galaxies~\cite{Bradascio:2019xdd}, blazars~\cite{Aartsen:2016lir}, $\gamma$-ray bursts~\cite{Abbasi:2012zw,Aartsen:2014aqy,Aartsen:2016qcr,Aartsen:2017wea}, fast radio bursts~\cite{Aartsen:2017zvw}, nearby galaxies~\cite{Aartsen:2019xkn}, diffuse Galactic emission~\cite{Albert:2018vxw}, Galactic $\gamma$-ray sources~\cite{Kheirandish:2019bke}, pulsar wind nebulae~\cite{Aartsen:2020eof}, or X-ray binaries\cite{Abbasi:2011ke}. IceCube takes also part in various realtime multi-messenger activities via the fast response to external alerts in photons~\cite{Abbasi:2011ja,Aartsen:2015trq} or gravitational waves~\cite{Adrian-Martinez:2016xgn,ANTARES:2017iky,Aartsen:2020mla} and by providing astrophysical neutrino candidates~\cite{Aartsen:2016lmt,AyalaSolares:2020ing}. Recently, IceCube was able to report first compelling evidence of neutrino emission from the $\gamma$-ray blazar TXS 0506+056~\cite{Finley:2019vpk,IceCube:2018cha}.

This paper accompanies the public data release of track-like neutrino candidates detected by IceCube between April 6, 2008 and July 10, 2018. The underlying event selection, \MA{called {\tt PSTracks} in the following}, is designed for point-source studies, that benefit from the good angular resolution of tracks and can tolerate larger atmospheric background contributions compared to diffuse neutrino analyses. In the following we give an account of the IceCube detector, the event selection and detector performance. We also highlight changes to previous data selections and releases.

\section{The IceCube Observatory}

The IceCube Observatory identifies neutrino interactions in the vicinity of the detector by the Cherenkov light emitted by relativistic charged secondary particles traveling through the deep ultra-clear glacial ice. The in-ice detector consists of 5,160 Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) that are distributed across a fiducial volume of one cubic kileometer~\cite{Abbasi:2008aa, Abbasi:2010vc}. The DOMs are distributed on 86 read-out and support cables (``strings'') and are deployed between 1.5~km and 2.5~km below the surface. Most strings follow a triangular grid with a width of 125~m, evenly spaced over the volume. The DOMs consist of a photomultiplier tube, electronics for digitization, and LEDs for detector calibration~\cite{Abbasi:2008aa, Abbasi:2010vc}.

Eight strings are placed in the centre of the array and are instrumented with a denser DOM spacing and typical inter-string separation of 55~m. They are equipped with photomultiplier tubes with higher quantum efficiency. These strings, along with the first layer of the surrounding standard strings, form the \emph{DeepCore} low-energy sub-array~\cite{Collaboration:2011ym}. While the main IceCube array has a neutrino energy threshold of about 100~GeV, the addition of the denser infill lowers the energy threshold to about 10~GeV. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory includes a surface array of water Cherenkov detectors called \emph{IceTop}~\cite{IceCube:2012nn} that detects and reconstructs air showers above $300\:$TeV using 82 ice tanks. The data presented in this release uses IceTop's capabilities to veto cosmic-ray-induced backgrounds.

The event selection targets high-energy muons produced by the interaction of astrophysical neutrinos in the vicinity of the detector. These \emph{track}-like events originate primarily in charged-current interactions of muon (anti-)neutrinos ($\nu_\mu$ \& $\bar{\nu}_\mu$) with nucleons, but also in similar interactions of tau (anti-)neutrinos ($\nu_\tau$ \& $\bar{\nu}_\tau$) with the tau lepton decaying to muons and neutrinos, or interactions of electron antineutrinos ($\bar{\nu}_e$ with electrons by resonant $s$-channel $W^-$ exchange~\cite{Glashow:1960zz}. Below $700$~GeV, muons lose energy mainly due to ionization; above $700$~GeV, stochastic energy losses due to radiative emission become the dominant component. At TeV energies, muons travel long distances, larger than several kilometers in the Antarctic ice~\cite{Chirkin:2004hz}. Light is constantly emitted along the track. The resulting long lever arm gives a good reconstruction performance with median angular resolution $\Delta\Psi<1\deg$. The absolute pointing accuracy of IceCube has been demonstrated to be $\lesssim0.2^\circ$~\cite{Aartsen:2013zka} via measurements of the effect of the Moon shadow on the background cosmic ray (CR) flux. 

Charged-current interactions of electron or tau neutrinos, as well as neutral current interactions of any neutrino type, also produce \emph{cascade}-like events. These types of interactions produce almost spherically symmetric light emission, giving a median angular resolution of $\sim10^\circ$--$15^\circ$\cite{Aartsen:2017eiu}. Another topology is induced by very high energy charged-current $\nu_\tau+\bar{\nu}_\tau$ interactions with the tau lepton decaying to hadrons after traveling a distance $\simeq50~{\rm m}~(E_\tau/{\rm PeV})$, resulting in two cascades separated distinctly. Candidates of these \emph{double-cascade} events have been recently identified~\cite{Stachurska:2019wfb}. These event signatures are in general less useful for point-source studies, unless one is looking for extended emission of local sources. Moreover, the event rate for track-like vents greatly increases because neutrinos can interact far outside the detector prior to the detection of the secondary muon with IceCube.  

The majority of the background for this event sample originates from CRs interacting with the atmosphere to produce showers of particles including atmospheric muons and neutrinos. The atmospheric muons from the Southern hemisphere are able to penetrate the ice and are detected as track-like events in IceCube at a rate orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding atmospheric neutrinos~\cite{Aartsen:2016nxy}. Almost all of the atmospheric muons from the Northern hemisphere are filtered out by the Earth. However, poorly-reconstructed atmospheric muons from the Southern sky create a significant background in the Northern hemisphere.
Atmospheric neutrinos also produce muons from charged-current muon (anti-)neutrinos interactions, acting as an irreducible background in both hemispheres. 

During the first three years of data included here, IceCube was incomplete and functioned with 40, 59, and 79 strings. For these years and also during the first year of data taking of the full detector (IC86), the event selection and reconstruction was updated until it stabilized in 2012, as detailed in Table.~\ref{tab:livetimes}. Seven years of tracks were previously analyzed to search for point sources~\cite{Aartsen:2016oji}. Subsequently, an eight-year sample of tracks from the Northern sky used for diffuse muon neutrino searches was also analyzed looking for point sources~\cite{Aartsen:2018ywr}. The aim of this work is to introduce a selection which unifies the event filtering adopted in these two past searches.

\end{figure}

\section{Event Selection}

Different criteria are applied to select track-like events from the Northern and Southern hemisphere (with a boundary between them at declination $\delta=-5^\circ$), because the background differs in these two regions. Almost all the atmospheric muons in the Northern hemisphere can be removed by selecting high-quality track-like events. In the Southern hemisphere, the atmospheric background is reduced by strict cuts on the reconstruction quality and minimum energy, since the astrophysical neutrino fluxes are expected to have a harder energy spectrum than the background of atmospheric muons and neutrinos. This effectively removes almost all Southern hemisphere events with an estimated energy below $\simeq10$~TeV; see Fig.~\ref{fig:enDist}. 

In both hemispheres, atmospheric muons and cascade events are further filtered using multi-variate Boosted Decision Trees (BDT). In the analysis~\cite{Aartsen:2019fau}, a single BDT is trained to recognize three classes of events in the Northern hemisphere: single muon tracks from atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos, atmospheric muons, and cascades, where neutrino-induced tracks are treated as signal. This BDT uses 11 variables related to event topology and reconstruction quality. The Northern BDT preserves $\sim90\%$ of the atmospheric neutrinos and $\sim0.1\%$ of the atmospheric muons from the initial selection of track-like events, also applied in previous muon neutrino searches~\cite{Aartsen:2016oji,Aartsen:2018ywr}. In the Southern hemisphere, the BDT and selection filters are taken from Ref.~\cite{Aartsen:2016oji}. The final all-sky event rate of $\sim2$~mHz is dominated by muons from atmospheric neutrinos in the Northern hemisphere and by high-energy, well-reconstructed muons in the Southern hemisphere. This updated selection applied to the final 6 years of data shown in Table~\ref{tab:livetimes}. The preceding four years of data are handled exactly as in the past.

\section{Detector Response}

Muon tracks induced by astrophysical neutrino interactions are the main signal category in the search for point-like sources of neutrinos. Detailed Monte Carlo simulation is used to evaluate the response of IceCube to such events and distinguish them from atmospheric backgrounds. The median angular resolution $\Delta\Psi$ and the event rate expectation
\begin{align}\label{eq:ev_rate}
\dot{N}_\nu=\int d\Omega\int_0^\infty dE\,A_\mathrm{eff}\left(E, \Omega\right) \phi_\nu\left(E_\nu,\Omega\right)
\end{align}
given by the detector \emph{effective area} $A_\mathrm{eff}$ and the incident neutrino flux $\nu_\nu$ can be derived from the simulation; see \cite{Aartsen:2016xlq}.

\section{Comparison to Previous Releases}

There have been multiple previous IceCube data releases selecting for track-like events in the Northern and Southern hemisphere, primarily for the purpose of neutrino astronomy ~\cite{Abbasi:2010rd,Aartsen:2013uuv,IceCube:2018,IceCube:2019,IceCube:TXS2018}. The dataset detailed in this document is the newest such attempt at creating a sample of track-like events, with the goal of standardizing the IC86 II-VII data taking period. This dataset can be considered to be a successor to the previous data release~\cite{IceCube:2019}, providing an updated description of the data from 2012--2016, as well as adding three additional years of data in 2016--2018. 

While similar  to the data release~\cite{IceCube:2019}, this sample includes several improvements in addition to the aforementioned standardization of the IC86 data taking periods. In this version of the data sample, the angular reconstruction has been improved, and the event classifier and sample pre-cuts have been altered to better reject cascade-like events and accept track-like events. The net effect of the sample changes is an increase in event rate relative to previous versions of the sample. A year-by-year comparison of event counts between the older and newer versions of this sample can be seen in Table ~\ref{tab:v2v3evtcontent}.

As an example of how the changing content of the different versions of this data sample can affect the process of searching for hotspots in IceCube data, we examine the 2014/2015 neutrino flare associated with TXS 0506+056~\cite{IceCube:2018cha}. The $3.5 \sigma$ excess seen in 2014/2015~\cite{IceCube:2018cha} was identified using the data sample corresponding to the data release~\cite{IceCube:2019}. Here, we repeat the untriggered flare search analysis of ~\cite{IceCube:2018cha}, but instead use the newest data sample presented in this document. The results of this cross-check can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:TXSCrossChecks}. Notably, the significance of the 2014/2015 neutrino flare appears to have decreased from $p=7.0 \times 10^{-5}$ to $p=8.1 \times 10^{-3}$ when using the most recent version of the data sample. A comparison of the reconstructed parameters of the most signal-like neutrino events contributing to the 2014/2015 flare in both versions of the data sample can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:TXSFlareEvtsTable} and Figure~\ref{fig:TXSEvtsCompare}.

The lower significance of the 2014/2015 neutrino flare in the most recent version of the sample appears to have been caused by the presence of two cascade-like events, occurring at MJD=56992.1586 and MJD=57014.1910, that existed in the data sample~\cite{IceCube:2019} associated with Ref.~\cite{IceCube:2018cha}, but have been removed from the data sample presented in this document. These two events did not pass a track length pre-cut that was introduced in the newest version of this data sample, requiring that all northern-sky events have a reconstructed track length greater than 200 meters. This pre-cut is intended to filter out poorly localized cascade events prior to applying the BDT. Performing the untriggered flare search using an older version of the sample (Ref.~\cite{IceCube:2019}), but with the two cascade events manually removed seems to result in a drop in significance similar to that which is observed when using this sample, as seen in Table~\ref{tab:TXSCrossChecks}. The drop in significance cannot be otherwise adequately explained by changes to the angular reconstruction of events between the two versions of the sample. 

 It should be noted that the apparent drop in significance of the 2014/2015 neutrino flare is not entirely unprecedented. A drop in the time integrated significance of TXS 0506+056 is also seen in Ref.~\cite{Aartsen:2019fau} when using the newer version of this sample: $p=2 \times 10^{-5}$ ($4.1\sigma$) with {\tt PSTracks 2019} ~\cite{IceCube:2018cha}, and $p=1.9 \times 10^{-4}$ ($3.5\sigma$) with {\tt PSTracks 2020} ~\cite{Aartsen:2019fau}. While both the time integrated and untriggered flare results associated with TXS 0506+056 appear to be less significant when using the newer version of this data sample, it is important to recognize that the results presented here are all \textit{a posteriori} cross checks preformed in order to explore the effects of the altered content of {\tt PSTracks 2020} in comparison to previous versions. The results of these checks are not intended to supersede the results shown in Ref.~\cite{IceCube:2018cha}.

\caption[]{The most signal-like events contributing to the 2014/2015 TXS 0506+056 neutrino flare in, both, the data sample published in Ref.~\cite{IceCube:2019} ({\tt PSTracks} 2019) as well as the data sample presented here ({\tt PSTracks 2020}). There were no changes to energy reconstruction between the two sample versions, but the angular reconstruction and sample event content have changed. The events occurring at MJD=56992.1586 and MJD=57014.1910 are cascade events that have been treated as tracks by the reconstruction, and as such the direction and energy information reported in the {\tt PSTracks 2019} sample is unlikely to be a good description of the true event properties.}\label{tab:TXSFlareEvtsTable}
